<h2 id="Shopify">1. Shopify</h2>
<p><i>The best ecommerce website builder for small businesses looking to grow</i> </p>
<a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Shopify_homepage.png?format=webp&v=1615426019" alt="Shopify e-commerce" width="690" height="360">

<br>
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> is the easiest and most reliable way to bring your business online. As an ecommerce platform, Shopify makes it simple to build an online store without any coding skills or a big budget.
Shopify powers over one million businesses and is known for its affordable pricing, beautiful designs, and helpful marketing tools. </p>
<p>If you want to create a Shopify store, you can choose from over 100 professional templates with built-in features, such as SSL certifications, domain hosting, abandoned shopping cart recovery,
   and other powerful tools to help you find customers, make sales, and manage your day-to-day operations. You can sell unlimited products through your ecommerce store and across multiple marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy through Shopifyâ€™s native partner integrations. </p>
<p>Additionally, Shopify Payments makes it easy to take payments online. You can integrate with over 100 payment gateways from around the world, including bitcoin, PayPal, and Shop Pay. There are also over 4,000 free Shopify apps you can use to extend your storeâ€™s functionality, keep ecommerce website costs low, and sell more online.</p>
<br>
<p style="color: black;"><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Over 100 professional themes created by world-renowned designers, such as Happy Cog and Pixel Union</li>
  <li>Built-in mobile commerce shopping cart, so shoppers can buy on any mobile device or tablet </li>

</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



<h2 id="Wordpress">2. Wordpress (WooCommerce)</h2>
<p><i>Best open source ecommerce website builder</i></p>
<a href="https://woocommerce.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/WooCommerce.png?format=webp&v=1615426420" alt="WooCommerce e-commerce" width="690" height="360">
</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>WooCommerce is an open source platform for sellers using WordPress. Itâ€™s not an independent website builder; rather, itâ€™s a WordPress ecommerce plugin you can use to add ecommerce features to a website. Youâ€™ll likely want to work with a developer if you use this ecommerce website builder.</p>
<p>WooCommerce gives you flexibility to manage website features such as inventory and tax management, secure payments, and shipping integrations. Like WordPress, WooCommerceâ€™s features can be extended with thousands of Wordpress plugins and themes and different extensions built just for WooCommerce. Itâ€™s known for its large pool of developers, which you can easily access if you need to make advanced changes to your WooCommerce store.</p>
<br>
<p style="color: black;"><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Exclusively built for WordPress, with connection to its ecosystem</li>
  <li>Mobile-friendly stores to make your products look good on any device </li>
  <li>Complete control over customer and business dataâ€”no third-party software has access</li>
  <li>100% open source for complete control over how your website looks and operates</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2 id="Wix">3. Wix</h2>
<p><i>Best ecommerce website builder for individual sellers</i> </p>
<a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Wix_ecommerce_website_builder.png?format=webp&v=1615426350" alt="Wix e-commerce" width="690" height="360">
</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>Following the industry trend of ecommerce, Wix now tackles online stores through its nontechnical website builder. You can use Wixâ€™s drag-and-drop builder to create an online store that meets your needs. Wix offers customizable templates, domain name registration, and web hosting to help you get online with ease.</p>
<p><b style="color: black;">The big drawback?</b> You can build an ecommerce website for free, but you canâ€™t sell anything until you upgrade to a paid plan.</p>
<p>Wix has a few helpful tools to manage your ecommerce business. It allows you to track orders, accept online payments, sell on multiple channels, and build abandoned cart campaigns. However, Wixâ€™s basic plan lacks some crucial inventory management features, such as low-stock alerts, tax calculators, and dropshipping capabilities. If you have a big inventory, youâ€™ll want an ecommerce platform with more effective inventory-tracking tools.</p>
<br>
<p style="color: black;"><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple editing interface to build your online store</li>
  <li>Customisable templates to tailor your site from storefront to checkout</li>
  <li>Integrations to help sell on Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, and eBay</li>
  <li>Free SSL certificate to protect customersâ€™ personal information and payments</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>





<h2 id="Squarspace">4. Squarspace</h2>
<p><i>Best ecommerce website creator for creatives</i> </p>
<a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/Squarespace.png?format=webp&v=1615426204" alt="Squarspace e-commerce" width="690" height="360">
</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>The next ecommerce site builder on the list is Squarespace. Its drag-and-drop builder makes it easy to use with little technical knowledge. Similar to Wix, it was a traditional website builder first, not an online selling platform, so there can be a small learning curve on the back end when setting up an online store.</p>
<p>Squarespace offers well-designed templates to start designing your store. Once you choose a template, you can customize the colors, text, and images to align with your brand. However, you canâ€™t sell anything online until you upgrade to a paid plan.</p>
<p>When using Squarespace as your ecommerce solution, you can only accept payments through Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, and Afterpay. You can sell gift cards and subscriptions when you sign up for the Commerce Advanced plan.</p>
<br>
<p style="color: black;"><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Drag-and-drop builder with customisable templates and starter layouts to build your store</li>
  <li>Automatically responsive designs and image scaling</li>
  <li>Custom WYSIWYG editing to support content types and complex layouts</li>
  <li>Lets you sell an unlimited amount of products</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>





<h2 id="BigCommerce">5. BigCommerce</h2>
<p><i>Best ecommerce website building software for big companies</i> </p>
<a href="https://www.bigcommerce.co.uk/" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/7032/files/BigCommerce_enterprise.png?format=webp&v=1615426255" alt="BigCommerce e-commerce" width="690" height="360">
</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>BigCommerce is an online storefront builder for enterprise-level companies. It offers web hosting and tons of customization options for tech-savvy business owners who want to scale. You canâ€™t register your domain name through BigCommerce, so youâ€™ll need to buy a domain name elsewhere and connect it to your store.</p>
<p>BigCommerces advanced features include international selling capabilities, SEO apps and optimized stores, and multichannel sales capabilities on social and online selling sitesâ€”but these features come with more complexity.</p>
<p>Retailers like Grace & Lace found the lack of flexibility and ease of use to be major drawbacks of using BigCommerce. After trying to work with the platform, Grace & Lace decided to move over to Shopify Plus, Shopifyâ€™s enterprise solution. This gave it access to powerful business tools and add-ons for its new Shopify Plus store and gave conviction for 20% year-over-year growth since migrating. </p>
<br>
<p style="color: black;"><b>Key Features:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Visual editor to edit website pages with a drag-and-drop tool</li>
  <li>Customisable themes built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
  <li>Digital wallet payment options with wallets like Amazon Pay, Apple Pay, and more</li>
  <li>Multi-currency and multi-language support for international sales</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
